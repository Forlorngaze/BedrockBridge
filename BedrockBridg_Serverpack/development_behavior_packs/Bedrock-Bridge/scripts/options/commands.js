// This file contains a list of commands that can be run from discord by doing /command. Commands not present in the list won't be allowed by default, hence if you want to allow only a few commands you may delete the entire list and replae it with such commands (in the right format).
// If you want to disable all commands simply replace the list with the following: export const allowed_commands = {}
export const allowed_commands = {}
